### Design Patterns

#### 1. **Model-Service-Component Architecture**

- **Models**: Define data structures with validation and utility methods
- **Services**: Manage state, business logic, and data persistence (Singleton pattern)
- **Components**: Handle UI presentation and user interactions

#### 2. **Offline-First Design**

- localStorage persistence for all data
- Mock data initialization for first-time users
- Service layer abstraction for easy API integration

#### 3. **Factory Pattern**

- Models use factory methods (`fromJson`) for safe object creation
- Validation and type checking during object construction

#### 4. **Composition API**

- Modern Vue 3 patterns with `<script setup>`
- Reactive state management with `ref` and `computed`
- Clean separation of concerns

## 🔧 API Integration Readiness

The application is designed for easy backend integration:

### Service Layer Abstraction

```typescript
// Each service method includes API integration points
if (!this._offlineMode) {
  await this.syncToAPI('create', newTask);
}
```

### Async/Await Pattern

All CRUD operations are async-ready for HTTP requests.

### Error Handling

Service methods include try-catch blocks for network error handling.

### Data Serialization

Models include `fromJson` factory methods for API response parsing.

## 🧪 Testing the Application

### Sample Data

The application includes realistic mock data with:

- 10 sample tasks with various priorities and due dates
- 5 team members with different roles
- Overdue tasks for testing edge cases
- Completed and pending tasks for statistics

### Test Scenarios

1. **Task Creation** - Create new tasks with all fields
2. **Task Editing** - Modify existing tasks
3. **Search & Filter** - Test all filter combinations
4. **Bulk Operations** - Select multiple tasks and perform actions
5. **Responsive Design** - Test on different screen sizes
6. **Data Persistence** - Refresh browser to test localStorage
7. **Error Handling** - Test edge cases and validations

## 🔮 Future Enhancements
